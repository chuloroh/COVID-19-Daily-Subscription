# Things to do

## Front end
We need a form to create subscriptions. The form should take an email address, and have fields for adding regions/states.

## Background jobs
We need a job that runs daily and pulls the latest covid 19 data from john hopkins github page.
The job will need to update all the state/regions in the database.

## APIs
### DELETE
* unsubscribe

### POST
* create subscription

### GET
* get all regions and states
